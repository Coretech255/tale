# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a simple blog application built with React designed as an educational tutorial spanning one month. The application will be structured to teach React fundamentals progressively, with each day focusing on specific concepts and features. The tutorial will cover authentication, CRUD operations, state management, routing, and other essential React concepts through practical implementation.
